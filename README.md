# Agricultural Post-Harvest Loss Analysis
This project analyzes post-harvest losses (PHL) in the agricultural value chain using Power BI.
The dashboard evaluates spoilage patterns, revenue loss, technology adoption, youth involvement, and regional disparities to support data-driven policy and operational decisions.
 ## Problem Statement
Post-harvest losses significantly reduce farmer income and food availability. This project aims to **quantify revenue loss, identify key spoilage drivers,
and evaluate the impact of storage, transport, and technology adoption**.
## Objectives
- Measure average post-harvest loss percentage
- Analyze revenue loss across regions and market access levels
- Evaluate spoilage by crop type and season
- Assess the impact of technology usage on spoilage reduction
- Compare trained vs untrained farmers in terms of revenue loss
## Data Description 
- Crop types: Maize, Yam, Cassava, Pepper, Rice, Tomato
- Metrics: Spoilage (kg), Revenue Loss (NGN), Distance (km)
- Dimensions: Region, Season, Transport Mode, Storage Type, Technology Used
- Time period: 2023–2024
